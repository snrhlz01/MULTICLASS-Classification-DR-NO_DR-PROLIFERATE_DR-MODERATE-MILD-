# MULTICLASS Classification - DR, NO DR, PROLIFERATE DR, MODERATE, MILD
This project involves image classification using a multi-class approach, with five distinct classes (DR, NO_DR, PROLIFERATE_DR, MODERATE, MILD). The classification is performed using a U-Net architecture in conjunction with the MobileNetV2 convolutional neural network, aiming to accurately categorize images into one of these five classes based on their content and characteristics.
# BINARY CLASSIFICATION - DR NO DR
Binary classification is divided into DR, which includes proliferate DR, moderate, mild, and NO DR using CNN and MobileNetV2 models.
